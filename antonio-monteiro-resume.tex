\emph{Curious by nature and a geek \emph{per se}, open source enthusiast with an entrepreneurial mindset, a passion for continuous learning and delivering value by designing and developing well-tested, maintainable software.}\\

After being introduced to programming as a freshman Electrical Engineering student, António quickly realised that he wanted to pursue a Software Development and Engineering career, dropping out to study Computer Science and Engineering. From 2010 to 2014, he studied and graduated in Computer Science, but didn't settle for what was being taught in classes, teaching himself a variety of skills outside the scope of the \emph{curriculum}, such as Python and Bash programming, \LaTeX\ and Beamer typesetting.

His passion for \acr{UNIX} and the open source movement made him want to try quite some different flavours of Linux, finally settling for \href{https://www.archlinux.org/}{ArchLinux} until, more recently, switching to OSX.

His curious by nature mindset took him to acknowledge the benefits of \acr{TDD}/\acr{BDD} and Extreme Programming methodologies, becoming almost an evangelist of Test Driven Development and Continuous Integration best practices.

His most recent passion is Full-Stack JavaScript and Node.js development, as well as document oriented NoSQL databases, which he is always eager to learn more about and build applications with.
